# Stack-Implementation
Stact implementation using Array and Linked List

In this Repository a couple of simple implementaion of stack has been included.
 -  Array Implementation
 -  Linked List Implementation
 
 Stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) kind of Data Structure. It is composed of the following operations:
 -  Push: It put a value at the top of the stack.
       - Care should be taken in case of stack over flow. This happens when we use the array based implementation.
 -  Pop: It removes the value at the top of the stack.
       - Can be performed only if the stack is NOT empty. To check if the stack is empty or not isempty operation shoulld be performed before the Pop operation.
 -  Top: It tells the value at the top of the stack.
 -  Is Empty: It tells if the stack is empty or not
