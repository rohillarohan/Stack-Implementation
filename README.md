# Stack-Implementation
Stack implementation using Array and Linked List

In this Repository a couple of simple implementation of stack has been included.
 -  Array Implementation
 -  Linked List Implementation
 
 Stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) kind of Data Structure. It is composed of the following operations:
 -  Push: It put a value at the top of the stack.
       - Care should be taken in case of stack over flow. This happens when we use the array-based implementation.
 -  Pop: It removes the value at the top of the stack.
       - Can be performed only if the stack is NOT empty. To check if the stack is empty or not isempty operation should be performed before the Pop operation.
 -  Top: It tells the value at the top of the stack.
 -  Is Empty: It tells if the stack is empty or not
 
Point to remember is that all the operation are done in constant time (O(1)). Therefore, in case of the Linked List Implementation the values have been added/deleted from the head of the linked list.
